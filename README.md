## How To Run The App
To get started:

+ clone the project or download it as a .zip file
+ open your terminal
+ cd into the project folder
+ install all project dependencies with `npm install`
+ start the development server with `npm start`

Alternatively, you can view the live version hosted on Netlify [here]().

### Get the API key

In order to fetch data from the API and display the movies, you need an API key. To get one, follow the steps outlined on the official website [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Once you have your own key, you can either manually insert it into the URL you will send a request to, or create a file and import it into the App.js component.
